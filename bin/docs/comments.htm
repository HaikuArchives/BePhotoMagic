<i><b>Note:</b> Read on only if you really want to hear what my thoughts were about this release and the work done since last release.</i>
<P>
Well, it feels like it's been a long time coming for this release. I had been planning for BPM to reach relative maturity by the end of this summer. After fighting with so many bugs which were in 0.61. I regret even putting 0.61 out because it sucked so bad. Ah, the School of Hard Knocks (tm). I genuinely tried to hunt down and squash every bug that was in the code. I found quite a few, and so things took a while. There are a few new features in 0.62, but this one is mostly just to do a lot of things to improve the BePhotoMagic's polish. A lot of little things were changed, like the UI labels.
<P>
There are a lot of things in the works. Anyone who studies the code any amount could probably figure that out. Most of them are currently disabled because the code for that feature still needs a lot of fixing. Better to release a little bit which works well than a lot of stuff which works 25% of the time. I don't know what 0.63 will be like, but there will be improvement, as always.

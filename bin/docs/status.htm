<hr WIDTH="100%">"Ho, hum, another useless, buggy Be app under development.
Wait a minute - this one almost works!"
<p>BePhotoMagic is the attempt to make one more dangerous app which allows users to avoid rebooting to a certain monopolizing, crappy platform-which-shall-remain-nameless in order to use Photoshop. Some people (like me) are a perhaps more than a little too impatient for Pixel32, GIMP, or Inferno, even though all three are under heavy development and making nice progress. BePhotoMagic tries to take from the best of both Photoshop and the GIMP, combine them with
(hopefully) a good dose of common sense for the interface. If nothing else, it's been good busy work. ;^)
<p>The BPM dev team is <b>very</b> interested in hearing your comments, suggestions, and criticism. Only by your feedback can we make changes and add features which the BeOS community wants. E-mail us at <a href="mailto:bpmagic@columbus.rr.com">bpmagic@columbus.rr.com</a>

<td><b><font size=+1>Known Issues:</font></b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td>Bezier</td>

<td>Unimplemented</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Bucket</td>

<td>Relatively fast, but due to the nature of the Undo code internals, lots of fills on a large image will chew through RAM faster than a hot knife through warm butter. Thus, it has the capacity to crash BeOS</td>
</tr>

<td>Stamp</td>

<td>Disabled - code needs serious cleanup
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Move</td>

<td>Unimplemented</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Erase</td>

<td>AFAIK, it works as it should except for the filled tools. Notify the team if you run into problems.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Filters</td>

<td>Carpet filter is *very* crash-prone - internal to the plugin itself.
<br>Qbist filter has been known to crash app once in a while
<br>Emboss filter will crash the app if you try to open a nonexistent file as a bump map
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>UI</td>

<td>Toolbar shortcuts will sometimes change the tool without the appropriate toolbar button being "turned on." This is caused by a kludge which will be fixed in a future release.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>File I/O</td>

<td>The gimp PAT translator will crash whatever app using it when opening
certain PAT files</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Filled Shapes</td>

<td>Don't use non-normal blending modes properly</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Other</td>

<td>Merge Down works better than before, but still not quite right</td>
